Hash Map / Set (Medium)

Given a 0-indexed n x n integer matrix grid, return the number of pairs (ri, cj) such that row ri and column cj are equal.

A row and column pair is considered equal if they contain the same elements in the same order (i.e., an equal array).

<8.1 1st attempt>
class Solution:
    def equalPairs(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        cnt = Counter(tuple(row) for row in grid) # converting the rows of the grid into tuples allows them to be used as keys in the Counter object;  tuple([1, 2]) and tuple([1, 2]) become the same tuple
        return sum(cnt[col] for col in zip(*grid)) # zip(*grid) takes each column of the grid and groups them together as tuples

Notes
1. many tricks here (Counter, tuple, zip(*grid))

<9.14 2nd attempt>
failed

Notes
1. lists are unhashable
