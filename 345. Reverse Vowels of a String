Array / String (Easy)

Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

class Solution:
    def reverseVowels(self, s: str) -> str:
        s = list(s)
        i = 0
        j = len(s)-1
        vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}

        while i < j:
            if s[i] in vowels and s[j] in vowels:
                s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
                i += 1
                j -= 1
            if s[i] not in vowels:
                i += 1
            if s[j] not in vowels:
                j -= 1

        return ''.join(s)

Notes
1. string vs. list ('str' object does not support item assignment) 2. use '.join()' to transfer lists to strings 3. s = [s] vs. s = list(s)

Notes
1. the meaning of 'reverse' 2. two pointers
