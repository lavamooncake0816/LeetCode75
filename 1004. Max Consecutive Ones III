class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        i = 0
        for j in range(len(nums)):
            k -= 1 - nums[j]
            if k < 0:
                k += 1 - nums[i]
                i += 1
        return j - i + 1

Notes
1. the idea is important (a moving 'memory' sliding frame)
