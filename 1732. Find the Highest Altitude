Prefix Sum (Easy)

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.

        l = []
        l.append(0)
        su = 0
        for i in range(len(gain)):
            su += gain[i] 
            l.append(su)
        return max(l)

Notes
1. avoid creating a list
