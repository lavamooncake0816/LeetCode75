Sliding Window (Easy)

You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer k.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.

class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        su = 0
        ma = float('-inf')
        for i, x in enumerate(nums):
            su += x
            if i >= k:
                su -= nums[i-k]
            if i >= k-1:
                ma = max(ma, su)
        return ma / k

Notes
1. the idea is important (keep updating the list) 2. pay attention to boundary indices 3. float('-inf')
