DP - 1D (Easy)

The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows: 

T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0.

Given n, return the value of Tn.

<10.1 1st attempt>
class Solution:
    def tribonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        s = [0, 1, 1]

        if n == 0:
            return 0
        elif n == 1 or n == 2:
            return 1
        else:
            for i in range(3, n+1):
                next = s[i - 1] + s[i - 2] + s[i - 3]
                s.append(next)
        
        return s[-1]

Notes
1. much slower than the first version
