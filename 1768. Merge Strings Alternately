Array / String (Easy)

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        l = []
        for i in range(min(len(word1), len(word2))):
            l.append(word1[i] + word2[i]) 
        if len(word1) > len(word2):
            l.append(word1[len(word2):])
            return ''.join(l)
        if len(word1) < len(word2):
            l.append(word2[len(word1):])
            return ''.join(l)
        else:
            return ''.join(l)

Notes
1. append() does not create a new list; append() takes exactly one argument 2. append() vs. join() 3. don't have to separate diff cases

Notes
1. ''.join()
